???+ cite "Do I have to pay for updates?"
    No. If you have bought the add-on it already, then all future updates are included for free. To get the newest version of the add-on, go to the store you made your purchase and download the latest build.

???+ cite "Why is *PCO* not installing?"
    - Try removing the old add-on directory before [installing](https://www.physicaladdons.com/pco/getting-started/#installation) the new version.
    - In MacOS, `Finder` sometimes automatically extracts the contents from the downloaded `.zip` file. You need to install the `.zip` file itself.
