**Do I have to pay for updates?**

No. If you have bought it already then all future updates are included for free. To get the new version of the addon go to the store you made your purchase and grab the latest version.

**Why is *PCO* not installing?**

- Try removing the old addon folder before [installing](https://www.physicaladdons.com/pco/getting-started/#installation) a new version.
- On Macs, Finder sometimes automatically unzips .zip files. You need to install the .zip file.
